    "# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis in Excel \n",
    "Before building the visualizations in Tableau, I used pivot tables and light data exploration in Excel to identify early trends and insights across the following focus areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Key Performance Metrics Overview:** Used monthly pivot summaries to observe Profit and ROI trends across time. This helped identify periods of peak performance (e.g. July–November) and areas where profit rose despite fluctuating ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Cost vs Revenue Efficiency:** Created custom pivot tables to compare CPC, CPM, RPC, and RPCon values across months. This made it easier to detect the mid-year spike in RPC and late-year RPCon surge, supporting cost-efficiency analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Engagement to Conversion Funnel Metrics:** Mapped Engagement Rate, CTR, and CVR in sequence to evaluate how user behavior influenced conversions. These findings were later used to shape the waterfall chart view in Tableau.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Regional Channel Performance Breakdown:** Built matrix-style pivot tables to compare key metrics (e.g. Revenue, Profit, ROI, Engagement) across London, Manchester, and Birmingham by channel. These insights guided the heatmap and map visualizations in the dashboard."

    "1.\t**Metrics/ KPIs:** I experienced blockers while trying to create my dashboard. Although the dataset was cleaned in excel, when transferred to Tableau there were issues with the columns. To troubleshoot I created new calculated fields because these columns were returning nulls and errors: CPC, CPM, RPC, RPCon, ROI, Conversion Rate, CTR, ROAS, Engagement Rate. I renamed columns by adding “Old” before the name (eg: Name changed from CPC to Old CPC)\n",

    "3.\t**Parameters:** Created a parameter for my stacked bar chart called “Pick a Parameter”.\n",
    "4.\t**Metric Selected:** Created calculated field for parameters chosen. I experiences problems with null values and so, to troubleshoot I added the “ELSE 0” function.\n",
    "5.\t**Metric Selected 2 Decimals:** The amounts for my metric selected in my stacked bar chart tooltip were not displaying the values with 2 decimal places. To troubleshoot, I created a new calculated field using this function: \"£\" + STR(ROUND([Metric Selected], 2)).\n"
