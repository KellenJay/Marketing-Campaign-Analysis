    "1.\t**Metrics/ KPIs:** I experienced blockers while trying to create my dashboard. Although the dataset was cleaned in excel, when transferred to Tableau there were issues with the columns. To troubleshoot I created new calculated fields because these columns were returning nulls and errors: CPC, CPM, RPC, RPCon, ROI, Conversion Rate, CTR, ROAS, Engagement Rate. I renamed coloumns by adding “Old” before the name (eg: Name changed from CPC to Old CPC)\n",
    "2.\t**Spark Lines:** Created calculated fields for sparklines to reflect max and min values. These points are viewed using dual-axis so that they aligned with line chart\n",
    "3.\t**Parameters:** Created a parameter for my stacked bar chart called “Pick a Parameter”.\n",
    "4.\t**Metric Selected:** Created calculated field for parameters chosen. I experiences problems with null values and so, to troubleshoot I added the “ELSE 0” function.\n",
    "5.\t**Metric Selected 2 Decimals:** The amounts for my metric selected in my stacked bar chart tooltip were not displaying the values with 2 decimal places. To troubleshoot, I created a new calculated field using this function: \"£\" + STR(ROUND([Metric Selected], 2)).\n"
