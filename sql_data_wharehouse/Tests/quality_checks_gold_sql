Quality Checks for Gold Layer: fact_campaign
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script validates key KPIs and logic in 'gold.fact_campaign' to ensure
    consistency, accuracy, and readiness for analytical reporting.

    Checks include:
    - Business key nulls and granularity
    - Metric validity and derived KPI sanity
    - ROI, Conversion Rate, and Profit logic alignment

-- ============================================================
-- Check for NULLs in critical columns
-- Expectation: Key fields and calculated metrics must not be NULL
SELECT *
FROM gold.fact_campaign
WHERE 
    Campaign IS NULL OR
    Date IS NULL OR
    City IS NULL OR
    Ad IS NULL OR
    Ad_Spend IS NULL OR
    Revenue IS NULL OR
    Conversions IS NULL;

-- ============================================================
-- Check for duplicate records (Campaign + Date + City)
-- Expectation: One row per Campaign-Date-City combination
SELECT 
    Campaign,
    Date,
    City,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM gold.fact_campaign
GROUP BY Campaign, Date, City
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- ============================================================
-- Validate metric bounds for key KPIs
-- Conversion Rate should be 0–100%, Engagement Rate 0–100%, ROI ≥ -100%
SELECT *
FROM gold.fact_campaign
WHERE 
    Conversion_Rate < 0 OR Conversion_Rate > 100 OR
    Engagement_Rate < 0 OR Engagement_Rate > 100 OR
    ROI < -100;

-- ============================================================
-- Ensure Profit = Revenue - Ad_Spend
SELECT *
FROM gold.fact_campaign
WHERE 
    ROUND(Profit, 2) != ROUND(Revenue - Ad_Spend, 2);

-- ============================================================
-- Insight Check: Conversions with zero revenue
-- Business Interpretation: Low or no-value conversions; may indicate poor ROI campaigns
SELECT 
    Campaign,
    Date,
    Channel,
    Ad,
    Conversions,
    Revenue,
    ROI,
    Performance_Flag
FROM gold.fact_campaign
WHERE 
    Conversions > 0 AND Revenue = 0
ORDER BY Date;

-- ============================================================
-- Optional sanity: Check for CTR values over 1 (should be a proportion)
SELECT *
FROM gold.fact_campaign
WHERE CTR > 1;

-- ============================================================
-- Validate performance flag logic (flag as 'Loss-Making' only if Profit < 0)
SELECT *
FROM gold.fact_campaign
WHERE 
    Profit >= 0 AND Performance_Flag = 'Loss-Making'
    OR
    Profit < 0 AND Performance_Flag = 'Healthy';
